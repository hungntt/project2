# Deploying the Neighborly App with Azure Functions

## Notes
- I temporarily remove /NeighborFrontEnd/templates folder due to the problem "Your submission contains too many files"
- All screenshots are in folder /screenshots with the numbering according to the rubrics.
  - Notes: Screenshots of Front-ends from local and live app are the same so I uploaded only from the live app
  - Live app URL: https://hungnttwa.azurewebsites.net/
